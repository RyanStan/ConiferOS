How to run with gdb:
	make sure to use tmux and split panes
	in one pane run: 'qemu-system-i386 -s -S -hda ./bin/disk.img'

	in the other pane run: 'gdb'.  
	Then in gdb: 
		'add-symbol-file bin/kernel.elf 0x100000'
		'target remote localhost:1234'

Helpful gdb commands:
	'layout asm'
	'info registers'
	'b <file>:<line>'
	'c'
	'tui enable'
	'step'
	'next'
	'stepi'
	'x /1wx 0x380' --> print out 32 bits at address 0x380 and format has hex
	'x /1hu 0x380' --> print out the 16 bits at 0x380 and format has unsigned decimal


ndisasm -b32 --> disassemble 32 bit 80x86 binary code
